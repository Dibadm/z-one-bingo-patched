# HABESHA BET - TELEGRAM CHAT BOT
#
# The chat bot is a lightweight interface only. All gameplay
# (rooms, card buying, number calling, win detection) happens
# inside the Mini App. The chat bot handles:
#   - User registration + phone collection
#   - Deposit instructions
#   - Withdraw / Transfer flows
#   - Balance, profile, transactions
#   - Daily bonus, referrals
#   - Admin dashboard
